# rosflight Aruco Localization
A hardware and software platform capable of manual and autonomous flight leveraging the ROSflight firmware and ROS infrastructure (ROSflight's docs are available [here](https://rosflight.org/)). This repo contains ROS code for fully-autonomous indoor flight of a quadcopter using fiducial markers in the environment for global position localization.

**Note:** Development of this project continued on the UAVs@Berkeley [v2v-comm-v2 project](https://github.com/UAVs-at-Berkeley/v2v-comm-v2) repo.
